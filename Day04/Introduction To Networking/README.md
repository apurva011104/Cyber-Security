# Introduction To Networking

## Computer Network
- A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices and computers that can communicate and share resources with each other.
- The primary purpose of a computer network is to enable these devices to exchange information efficiently and securely.

## Types Of Networks
There are mainly five types of Computer Networks
1. **Personal Area Network (PAN) :**  Type of network designed to connect devices within a short range, typically around one person.
2. **Local Area Network (LAN) :**  Type of computer network that connects computers through a common communication path, contained within a limited area, i.e., locally.
3. **Campus Area Network (CAN) :**  Type of computer network that is usually used in places like a school or colleges.
4. **Metropolitian Area Network (MAN) :**  Type of computer network that connects computers over a geographical distance through a shared communication path over a city, town, or metropolitan area.
5. **Wide Area Network (WAN) :**  Type of computer network that connects computers over a large geographical distance through a shared communication path.

## Computer Network Layered Architecture
### OSI Model
- OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a seven-layered framework that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.
- It was developed by ISO in 1984.
- The seven layers (in order) are:
  1. **Physical Layer :**  Responsible for providing a physical medium for the transmission of bits.
  2. **Data Link Layer :**  Responsible for fragmentation, physical addressing, synchronisation, flow control and error control.
  3. **Network Layer :**  Responsible for locating destination of your request, routing and logical addressing.
  4. **Transport Layer:**  Responsible for segmentation, port addressing, flow control and error control.
  5. **Session Layer :**  Responsible for creating a session between devices.
  6. **Presentation layer :**  Responsible for translation, encryption and compression.
  7. **Application Layer :** Responsible for defining protocols which are going to be used.
### TCP/IP Model :**
