# Introduction To Cyber Security
## Cybersecurity: Definition, Importance, Scope
- Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems,networks and data from malicious attacks or cyber crimes.
- It is important because the number of cyber crimes are increasing day-by-day. To balance ann individual's rights and privacy and to ensure that critical infrastructure do not collapse under any situation, we need cybersecurity.
- The scope of cybersecurity includes threat prevention and management, network security, information security, application security, cloud security and endpoint security.

## Types of Cyber Threats
1. #### **Malware**
   - Malware is abbrevation of malicious software. It is a program or script that was intentionally developed to destroy data, to cause damage to the normal functionality of a computer or network, or to perform malicious activities.
   - Malware can be classified into following types:
     1. **Virus:** Malware that injects its malicious code into other files in a target system.
     2. **Worms:** Malware that exploits software vulnerabilities and backdoors to gain access to an operating system.
     3. **Trojans:** Malware that pretends to be harmless, in order to deceive the victim into loading and executing it.
     4. **Ransomeware:** This malicious program prevents users from accessing their system, either by disabling the system's functionality or by locking the users' files and displays a message that demands ransome to restore its functionality.
     5. **Rootkits:** These are a set of malicious software tools that give attackers privileged access to the victim system.
     6. **Spyware:** This malware installs secretly on the target system for the purpose of monitoring the user's activities without their knowledge.
2. #### **Phishing**
   - Phishing is a process of acquiring personal and sensitive information of an individual via email by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication.
3. #### **Denial Of Service (DOS)**
   - Overloading a system, service, or network to disrupt its availability
4. #### **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)**
   - **Eavesdropping:** Unauthorized interception of communication between two parties.
   - **Session Hijacking:** Intercepting and taking over an established session between a user and a system.

## Hacking
- Hacking refers to the unauthorized access, manipulation, or exploitation of computer systems or networks.
- **Hackers** exploit vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information, disrupt services, or commit fraud.
- **Types of hackers**
  1. **Black hat hackers:** Hackers who engage in hacking with malicious intent. Their actions are typically illegal and unethical.
  2. **White hat hackers:** Hackers who use their hacking skills for good and with ethical intentions. These hackers are also known as ethical hackers.
  3. **Grey hat hackers:** These hackers are somewhere in between white and black hat hackers. They may have mixed motivations, and their actions can be morally ambiguous.

## CIA Triad
- CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- It is one of the models often used to describe the relationship between security and its objects.
- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can have access to the system or information.
- **Integrity:** Ensure that data is maintained properly and nobody should be able to modify in some way that is not intended.
- **Availability:** Authorized user should be able to access information or system whenever and however they need.

## Cybersecurity Ethics, Principles and Best Practices
- #### **Ethics:**
  - Cybersecurity ethics involve principles and guidelines that govern the behavior of individuals and organizations in the field of cybersecurity.
  - It includes confidentiality, integrity, availability, legal compilance, ethical hacking, respect for Intellectual Property.
- #### **Principles:**
  - The purpose of the cyber security principles is to provide strategic guidance on how an organisation can protect their systems and data from cyber threats.
  - It includes confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, accountability, defense in depth, security by design.
- #### **Best Practices**
  - Use strong passwords
  - Use trusted antivirus in devices
  - Keep your device software updated
  - Use secure network
  - Never open attachments in spam emails
  - Regularly back up data to prevent data loss
